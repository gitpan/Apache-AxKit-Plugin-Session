Apache::AxKit::Plugin::Session version 0.94
===========================================

This is a session management plugin for AxKit. It features
Session ID tracking via URL encoding or cookies, with auto-
fallback when cookies are not avialable. It also provides
utilities to avoid the pitfalls commonly encountered with
URL based session IDs. You get XSP taglibs for accessing
and modifying all session related data. The "Session"
taglib is compatible with Cocoon, while the others don't
have any known counterpart.
Read 'perldoc AxKit::XSP::Session' and '...::Auth' and
'...::Global' for usage details.
